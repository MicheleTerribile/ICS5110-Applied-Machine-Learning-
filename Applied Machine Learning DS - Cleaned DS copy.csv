29,Times of Malta,Driver stuck in traffic says speeding LESA car shattered his mirror,Emma Borg,07/12/2024,07/12/2024,"A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, ""LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question."" They continued, "" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.""","{Accident,Lesa,National}",Saturday,evening,1700,1,weekend,St Julians ,Regional Road,bypass,2,car-motorcycle,,,2,78,78,,,1,0,1,10,22.2,16,no,0,,

75,Times of Malta,Danish father ‘left in the dark’ about son killed in car accident,Giulia Magri,16/01/2025,22/10/2023,"The father of a Danish man who died after being hit by a car in St Julian’s a year and a half ago has been left in the dark as to what happened the night his son died. Asger Emil Neidhardt, a 25-year-old IT entrepreneur, arrived in Malta on October 22, 2023, for a holiday with friends. Six days later, he died after he was hit by a Honda Accord driven by a 44-year-old man in the Regional Road tunnels. While a police spokesperson said the family had been provided with updates on the investigation and the ongoing magisterial inquiry, Neidhardt’s father disputed this claim. “Ten days after the accident, my son arrived in Denmark in a coffin, and we never heard from the Maltese authorities about what happened to him,” Lars Neidhardt told Times of Malta. “It’s very frustrating to lose one’s child and not know what happened. Is the case being investigated Is the driver facing any consequences We are completely left in the dark.” While details of the accident are scarce, Neidhardt was in touch with the friends who were the last to see Asger. That night the group had gone out, yet Asger did not return to his accommodation with the others. “His friends called and texted him during the night, but he never answered,” he said. The next morning, the group headed to the police station to report their missing friend. There, a police officer informed them about the accident and asked them to identify the body. They confirmed it was Asger. Later in the day, Asger’s mother received a call from the Maltese police informing her that her son was killed in a car accident. Neidhardt then found online media reports about his son’s death. “One minute he is out for dinner and drinks, and then the next thing I find out is that my son is dead,” Neidhardt said. Ten days later, Asger’s body arrived in Denmark. His father recalled how more than 300 people attended his funeral in Aabenraa, the town where he grew up. Countless calls and emails Following the funeral, the family contacted the Danish Embassy (based in Rome) to see how they could get more information on what happened to Asger. The ambassador advised them to contact the attorney general. Since Asger’s death, his father has sent eight emails to the attorney general and made countless phone calls, only to receive the same response each time: the magisterial inquiry has not yet been concluded. “It is now more than one year since my son died in Malta, and I still haven’t heard one word from the authorities in Malta,” Neidhardt wrote in his last email to the attorney general on December 6, 2024. “Please be informed that the inquiry is not yet concluded,” was the response he received. Neidhardt has started to question if anything has happened since the accident. “I am never informed how long I have to wait for an update or if the case is still under investigation. Nothing.”  In a reply to questions regarding the magisterial inquiry, a police spokesperson said while the inquiry is still ongoing the family have been updated on the investigations. “While the investigating officer communicates with the family since the victim’s family resides abroad, they have been updated about the investigations and the inquiry through the Danish Consulate,” the spokesperson said. Neidhardt confirmed the family were never in touch with the authorities, nor did the Consulate reach out to them. “We have heard absolutely nothing.” ‘Spread joy because of his positive attitude’ Neidhardt recalled how his son loved life and enjoyed travelling around Europe with friends for new experiences. “He was a very caring, loving and funny young man, he loved his family and friends above all,” he said. “He spread joy in the family and his surroundings because of his positive attitude and energy.” The last time Lars saw his son was two weeks before he died, during a family weekend trip at a summer house. “I hugged him in the driveway before he drove off back home. I still can’t believe that I will never see him again.” This is not the first time that family members have raised questions about Maltese authorities following an incident. In 2016, Mike Mansholt, a 17-year-old who came to Malta on holiday, was found dead at the foot of Dingli Cliffs. The Maltese magisterial inquiry concluded that Mike had died of natural causes and police closed the case. While the Maltese and German post-mortem concluded that the teenager had no broken bones, the Medical University of Hanover uncovered that Mike was devoid of the heart, brain, neck organs, lungs, liver, pancreas, adrenal glands, right kidney, bladder, stomach and the small intestine. His backpack, along with his phone and GoPro camera, were never found. In 2021, Mansholt’s father asked the German courts to order the Maltese authorities to reopen investigations into his son’s mysterious death.","{Accident,Denmark,National,Police}",Sunday,,,,weekend,St Julians ,Regional Road,bypass,2,car-car,2,0,2,25,44,0,1,0,0,0,,,,fatal,1,,

The truck, the NGO said, ended up within the bicycle lane, where, had there been a bicycle user, they could have been fatally injured. ""The current road design offers no protection for cyclists, and this tragic event highlights the pressing need for proper segregation between high-speed traffic and vulnerable road users, particularly those on bicycles,"" ROTA said. The need for protected bicycle lanes is not just a local issue - the matter has also been flagged in international road safety guidelines such as the CROW guidelines. These guidelines emphasise the importance of segregation in high-speed areas and the need for roads that are forgiving of human error, the group noted. ""In simple terms, we must ensure that the consequences of mistakes ‚Äì whether made by a driver or a cyclist ‚Äì are not fatal. Sadly, Malta is still without a legally binding national cycling policy that will outline clear standards for the design and implementation of safe and effective bicycle lanes. ""We cannot allow cyclists to be subjected to what is, at best, a makeshift effort that often amounts to nothing more than a splash of green paint and some rumble strips. It is not enough. Bicycle lanes need to be designed to protect cyclists ‚Äì physically separated from traffic in high-speed areas, with sufficient space and barriers to prevent accidents.""","{Accident,National,Rabat}",Friday,Morning,1000,0,weekend,Rabat,Triq Buqana,bypass,1,truck,1,0,1,35,35,0,1,0,0,0,8,57.4,21,High,1,,

184,Times of Malta,"Motorcyclist injured in pothole incident awarded ‚€74,000",Monique Agius,09/05/2025,02/05/2020,"A 39-year-old Turkish national has been awarded over ‚Ç¨74,000 in damages following an accident in Siƒ°ƒ°iewi which left him suffering from a permanent disability. The man was driving his Piaggio Vespa along Triq Gƒßar Lapsi on May 2, 2020, when he stumbled into a pothole, lost his balance and fell off the motorcycle. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital where he was certified with grievous injuries. Following the incident, the man returned to Turkey since he needed treatment, and the coronavirus pandemic had hit. He also underwent several surgical interventions. As a result of the incident, he sustained permanent disability, which harmed his quality of life. The man eventually returned to Malta. Through his lawyers, he filed an application before the First Hall of the Civil Court, suing the Siƒ°ƒ°iewi Local Council and Infrastructure Malta. He requested the court to hold both responsible for the incident and order them to pay him damages. Both Infrastructure Malta and the Siƒ°ƒ°iewi local council argued that they were not suited, with the road agency arguing that the council was responsible for maintaining the road, while the local council argued that it was in the hands of the agency. In court, the man testified that as he was driving along Triq Gƒßar Lapsi, direction towards Dingli cliffs, a few meters after he turned the corner, the condition of the road changed dramatically. Who is responsible for the road He described how the road level went down by a few metres before he drove into a pothole. Moreover, there were no signs that the road surface would deteriorate, and the man said he had no reason to believe that the road surface would change in such a manner. John Fenech from Elles Urban Services Ltd ‚Äì a company engaged by the council to maintain the roads ‚Äì acknowledged that the road was in a state of disrepair and it had to be resurfaced. He also testified that the damage to the road was primarily attributable to the frequent passage of heavy vehicles in the service of nearby quarries. He added that the road was not built to take the weight of the vehicles. A police constable similarly testified that the road was in a bad state, noting that there were several cracks in the asphalt and potholes. In establishing who was responsible for the road, the court heard architect David Vassallo from Infrastructure Malta. The witness said the road fell under the responsibility of the local council, however, the road agency intervened and issued an emergency allocation to contractor Philip Agius and Sons for ‚Ç¨1.5 million, excluding VAT, in December 2020. The council‚Äôs executive secretary, Ritianne Giorgino, told the court that while it was within the council‚Äôs boundary, the local council is responsible for maintenance or patching works, while resurfacing falls under the responsibility of the local government. Referring to the mayor‚Äôs affidavit, the court observed that while it was outlined that the council has several structures to monitor and ascertain that roads are kept in a good state of repair, this was not the case and notwithstanding the ‚Äúlayers of surveillance adopted by the Council, somewhere down the line, somebody is not doing his job properly or else the technical operandi is not functioning."" The court reminded how the road is used by heavy vehicles and therefore, the road should have been monitored more closely and frequently. It also observed that it was only after the plaintiff was injured that the road was properly repaired. The court concluded that the council was wholly to blame for the accident.¬† When it came to calculating damages, it took into consideration that 21 months after the accident, the man‚Äôs radial nerve did not make a full recovery, and this was most likely improbable. It also took into consideration the court-appointed expert‚Äôs observations on the fracture of the distal tibia, which involved an articular surface of the ankle joint and will inevitably lead to arthritic change. The motorcyclist also ended up with substantial amounts of metal implants attached to the humerus and tibia. These foreign bodies provide a slightly increased risk of bone infection during bacetermia, according to the expert. After calculating the damages, the court declared the Siƒ°ƒ°iewi local council responsible for the incident and ordered it to pay the man ‚Ç¨74,873. Mr Justice Toni Abela presided over the court. Lawyers Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia assisted the plaintiff.","{Accident,Court,National,Roads,Siggiewi,Transport}",Saturday,,,,weekend,Siggiewi,Triq Ghar Lapsi,bypass,1,motorcycle,1,0,1,39,39,0,1,0,0,0,10,64.8,24,High,1,,

388,Times of Malta,Watch: â€˜Animals are treated better than us construction workersâ€™,Mark Laurence Zammit,11/09/2025,,"Restrictive road closure rules are forcing construction workers to start late and work through the hottest part of the day, contractors say. Veteran contractor Albert Tanti, who has been in the building business for nearly four decades, criticised current Transport Malta regulations, telling Times of Malta that â€œanimals are treated better than construction workersâ€ because while horses are banned from working during peak hours, protections for construction workers are much weaker.Â   Transport Malta sticks to its guns Transport Malta has no intention of changing the regulations. In a reply to questions, a spokesperson defended the authorityâ€™s policy, arguing the 9.30am restriction is essential to reduce traffic congestion â€œduring peak morning hours when thousands commute to work, school or to obtain other servicesâ€. â€œClosing residential streets earlier would risk significant disruption to traffic flow and limit emergency access,â€ he said. He said the authority does, however, consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis. In areas where a closure wouldnâ€™t affect schools or traffic flow, a permit might be granted for an earlier start.Â  He said the authority is open to discussing specific cases with contractors to find practical solutions. â€œWhere possible, Transport Malta seeks to assist works through measures such as temporary permits, phased closures or coordination with local councils to balance community needs and workersâ€™ safety,â€ he said. But Tanti and the building contractorsâ€™ association argue that due to the policy, workers often do not begin work until 11am â€“ the hottest part of the day â€“ due to the time it takes to set up and get materials on site. He said starting work later also means they must finish later. Working at night would hardly solve the problem and would create even more inconveniences for residents, he added. Allowing contractors to close side streets at 7am would be in everyoneâ€™s best interest, including the neighbours, he insisted, because the site would be completed earlier. And even with an earlier permit, they would not be able to start the actual work before 8am anyway, giving commuters a clear window before they leave for work, he said.","{Construction,National,Traffic}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

396,Times of Malta,Tougher measures against reckless drivers go before parliament,Times of Malta,16/09/2025,,"A bill to introduce random testing of motorists for drug and alcohol abuse went before parliament on Tuesday, with the Home Affairs Minister insisting that the changes had been in the works for some months. Calls for tougher legislation reached a crescendo this summer following a spate of traffic accidents in which the motorists involved were found to have been driving under the influence of drink or drugs. But Home Affairs Minister Byron Camilleri told the House that the government had declared its intention to beef up the laws even before parliament rose for the summer recess. ""We want to send a clear message to motorists that they cannot, through their actions, put others in danger,"" he said.Â  Motorists and pedestrians who observed the law deserved protection, he said, and while one could not control what everybody did or did not do, this legislation would serve as a stronger deterrent. Going into the provisions of the law, Camilleri said that henceforth, the police would be able to test motorists for drug abuse in the same way as they did for alcohol. And tests could be carried out randomly and not upon 'reasonable suspicion' as had been the case to date for drink-driving. Limits were not being changed, the minister said, but there would be 'zero tolerance' for anyone driving under the influence of illegal drugs such as cocaine or heroin. The minister pointed out that during talks with a number of organisations, concerns had been raised about how this new approach could negatively affect people taking medical cannabis who were perfectly fit to drive but could still be caught up in the tests. Similarly, people who took recreational cannabis days previously could also be caught up. There was also a risk that people wouldÂ  not take medicines prescribed by doctors for fear of being caught up in drug tests.Â  A well-researched document had been handed to the government and was being seriously considered.Â  The purpose of the new law was to ensure that everyone was responsible behind the wheel and to deter only those who were unfit to drive. But there would be zero tolerance of those who were reckless and prepared to put other people's lives in danger. No risks could be taken, which was why random testing was now also being introduced.Â   The minister said the police had bought new, modern test kits for drug testing. The procedure to be followed was that in the case of a positive drug test, a follow-up test would be taken to confirm the result. The new law also provided that when a traffic accident resulted in a fatality, the motorist would be sentenced to jail if convicted of having been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The possibility of a suspended sentence was being removed. Stiffer fines There would also be stiffer fines for those found to be driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The purpose was to strengthen the deterrent against those who, through their recklessness, risked injuring or killing somebody. A fine which previously stood at â‚¬1,800 was now being raised to â‚¬2,500 for a first offence. In a repeat offence, the current fine of â‚¬3,000 was being raised to â‚¬5,000. Furthermore, prosecutors may request immediate suspension of a motorist's driving licence, not when proceedings are completed. The law was also introducing stiffer penalties in hit-and-run cases.Â  In his address Camilleri said this was not the first time that the government was taking tough action to ensure that traffic laws were observed. Penalties for contraventions that could put people's lives in danger had actually been doubled in 2023. But strengthening the law had to be accompanied by actual enforcement, and this was happening too, with just the police having mounted 1,300 road checks this year up to August. Action would increase even more now that the police had a specialised Road Policing Unit.Â  10,000 found driving while on the phone this yearÂ  Action by the police and others such as LESA was not just focused on drink and drug driving. This year, up to August,10,000 fines were issued against motorists found using mobile phones at the wheel. 38,000 had been fined for this offence since 2022. All these people, clearly, were prepared to drive in a manner which endangered others, despite heavy fines, the minister said.Â  This underlined the need for educational campaigns to underscore the point that people should not put other people's lives at risk. ""The message is clear, the mobile phone can wait and if you drink or take drugs, your place is not behind the steering wheel,"" Camilleri said.

399,Times of Malta,Man accused of Bidnija murder charged with earlier â€˜road rageâ€™ attack,Monique Agius,18/09/2025,,"A man accused of murdering a driver after a minor road collision has been charged with a second alleged road rage incident that took place months before the fatal shooting. Mohamed Hamdan, 46, appeared in court yesterday to face a string of driving offencesÂ  over a January incident in St Paulâ€™s Bay, in which he allegedly rammed his truck into a car following a traffic dispute. The incident, caught on camera and exclusively revealed by Times of Malta, involved Hamdan allegedly attempting to park his truck to make a water delivery to a hotel. Police inspector Warren Galea told the court that the alleged victim, driving a red Mazda, had overtaken Hamdan and blocked his access to the designated delivery spot on Triq it-Turisti.Â   The two men exited their vehicles and initially exchanged words. The situation quickly escalated, and a passenger had to intervene to separate them. Hamdan then returned to his truck and drove into the Mazda, which was later declared a total loss. Three other parked vehicles were also extensively damaged. The court heard that the accused was arrested at the time but released on police bail until February 26, pending the submission of medical documentation by the alleged victim. Despite repeated visits by Hamdan to the Qawra police station to seek updates, the requested documents were not submitted until March. The alleged victim presented a medical certificate and vehicle damage valuation report, both dated January. Hamdan also sustained a scratch, which was certified as slight injuries. Hamdan was called back to the police station on April 15. He requested to have his lawyer, Nicholas Mifsud, present before any interrogation. However, inspector Galea explained that due to Mifsudâ€™s involvement in a high-profile jury case, the interview was postponed. Before a new date could be set, the fatal Bidnija shooting occurred. Hamdan was arrested and charged with murdering Jean Paul Busuttil in yet another traffic dispute. Given the circumstances, police decided to file the earlier road rage charges on July 4 without conducting a formal interrogation. Hamdan pleaded not guilty to wilful damage to a car, slightly injuring the driver, damaging three parked cars through negligent and reckless driving, dangerous driving and recidivism. The alleged victim took the stand yesterday. Cautioned that he could face charges himself, the man chose to testify. He said he had been collecting employees from the BuÄ¡ibba Hotel at around 6.30am when Hamdanâ€™s truck reversed towards him. He claimed he tried to manoeuvre around the truck, asking Hamdan to let him pass so the latter could park. The witness described Hamdan exiting the truck andÂ allegedly swearing and trying to punch him. He said his employees stepped in to defuse the situation, and as he returned to close the back passenger door, Hamdan drove his truck into his car and then several others. Under cross-examination, the alleged victim admitted that his car was in the middle of the road but insisted he had no alternative route to where he was going. He denied pushing Hamdan but admitted to â€œblockingâ€ him when the accused attempted to strike him. Lawyer Jacob Magri, representing the alleged victim as parte civile, requested a protection order following the testimony. The court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, is expected to rule on the matter from chambers. The case continues in October. Police inspector Warren Galea prosecuted. Lawyer Nicholas Mifsud assisted Hamdan. Lawyers Arthur Azzopardi and Jacob Magri are assisting alleged victim.","{Accident,Court,National}",,morning,630,1,,St Paul's Bay,Triq it-Turisti,residential street,5,car-truck,2,0,2,46,46,0,2,0,0,0,,,,med,0,,

404,Times of Malta,Bidnija â€˜nightmareâ€™ roadworks drag on past June deadline as residents fume,Marc Galdes,21/09/2025,29/06/2025,"Residents are frustrated that works to rebuild Bidnijaâ€™s main road have been ongoing since January, despite an initial June deadline. Infrastructure Malta (IM) attributed the delays mainly to the installation of new sewage pipes. Mosta mayor Joseph Gatt told Times of Malta such setbacks are common in large projects, particularly since no works had been carried out on this road for 30 years. He said the reconstruction should finally be completed within a â€œmaximumâ€ of two weeks. For nine months, IM has been rebuilding Triq il-Bidnija, which is the main road connecting the village to Mosta. A noticeboard on site states that the project was scheduled to last 18 weeks from its start on January 30, meaning it should have been completed by early June. Residents who spoke to Times of Malta on condition of anonymity complained about the inconvenience caused by the delay. Up until Friday, drivers entering Bidnija from Mosta were aallowed to pass through Triq il-Bidnija via a one-way lane. However, residents leaving the village to go towards Mosta were forced to use a narrow concrete country road. Traffic lights were also put up to help direct the traffic. After Times of Malta sent questions to IM, a resident said the traffic lights were taken down and Triq il-Bidnija was opened up for two-way traffic. Works are still ongoing further up the road towards Bidnija church.  Despite the progress, a resident said the roadworks have â€œbeen moving slowly for a considerable number of monthsâ€. Apart from causing inconvenience, a resident said the unfinished road generates a lot of dust, which was even making its way into his home. â€œIt has been a nightmare,â€ the resident said. â€œEvery time a car passes, it raises a cloud of dust that even enters our homes. With school about to start, the traffic and health concerns will only get worse.â€ The resident added that a relaÂ­tive of theirs suffered from bad hay fever attacks. â€œThere is so much dust. When I drive through, I cannot even see whatâ€™s behind me. The least they could do is spray some water on the road to reduce the amount of dust,â€ another resident suggested. Yesterday, after Times of Malta sent questions to IM, workers doused the road with water. In a statement, IM said â€œworks included the deep trenching for a new sewer trunk main and the addition of a new sewer rising main along the site. This factor has substantially compromised the final completion period of works, being in the critical path of the project.â€ Besides this, IM said that as the contractor was instructed to open one lane on the road, this further delayed the project. On the narrow concrete road, a road rage incident on June 29 led to the death of Jean Paul Busuttil. Mohamed Hamdan is accused of driving the wrong way down the road, colliding with Busuttil, then fatally shooting him after retrieving a firearm from his home.","{Infrastructure,Mosta,National,Roads,Traffic}",Sunday,morning,630,1,weekend,Bidnija,Triq il-Bidnija,main road,2,car-car,2,0,2,46,53,0,2,0,0,0,≥ 10.00,5.56,26,fatal,0,Newsbook,https://newsbook.com.mt/fil-bidnija-imut-wara-li-sewwieq-spara-fuqu-wara-habtaa/

410,Times of Malta,Watch: This is what students say would get them to vote,Marc Galdes,29/09/2025,,"If there were an election tomorrow, 16- and 17-year-old students who spoke to Times of Malta said they want political parties to give more priority to Maltese people and solve traffic problems by prioritising public and alternative modes of transport. The election of Alex Borg as the new leader of the opposition has shifted the political landscape. He told Times Talk that his plan is to target the vote of young people who feel disenfranchised by politics. In light of this and rumours of an early general election circling, Times of Malta visited GF Abela Junior College during Freshersâ€™ Week on Thursday to ask students what types of policies would encourage them to go out and vote. â€œI would vote for the party that promises to make Malta, Malta again,â€ one student said, adding that the ongoing development and the new buildings emerging lack a sense of Maltese identity and culture. Another student shared similar views, stressing the importance of safeguarding Maltese identity and cultural heritage. â€œWe need to stay united as a country, especially with the number of tourists that are coming to our country,â€ he said, adding that it is important to maintain our traditions like feasts. Malta is â€˜overcrowdedâ€™ Like him, other students said tourism had taken precedence. One student described the quality of tourists Malta is attracting as â€œhorrendousâ€. â€œMaltaâ€™s really changed. Due to high levels of tourism, certain places have to be more avoidable,â€ one student said. Someone else said Malta had become â€œovercrowdedâ€. Students shared these thoughts following a summer when tensions surrounding â€œovertourismâ€ escalated.  â€œSince there are a lot of tourists and immigrants, everything is getting more expensive and itâ€™s putting us teenagers at a disadvantage,â€ she said. Just like her, another student called for â€œliveable wagesâ€. â€œThe prices of everything keep on going up and the wages remain the same and itâ€™s becoming too costly to actually enjoy yourself while youâ€™re living,â€ she said. Trafficâ€¦  Responses showed that improving the public transport system and reducing traffic remains a hot topic for young people. â€œItâ€™s a bit difficult to get to school because of bus times and delays. I think we just need more bus stops in general,â€ one student said. Apart from buses, one student called for the implementation of the metro, which the prime minister has recently hinted at again after having been quietly shelved. Rather than improving public transport, other students called for policies that steer away from car use. â€œI think that cars shouldnâ€™t be allowed in Malta, given Maltaâ€™s small size,â€ one student said. Students also called for infrastructure that supports alternative modes of transport as well as creating more green open spaces.","{Lifestyle,National,Politics,Population,Tourism,Traffic,Transport}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incident happened in Naxxar Road, Birkirkara, on March 19, 2022. Esther Mifsud was arraigned before Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace and accused of dangerous and reckless driving, damaging the six parked cars due to negligence, and driving under the influence of alcohol. She denied the charges. The court observed that affidavits presented in court were â€œinconclusiveâ€ and â€œconfusingâ€ as to who was actually driving the vehicle at the time of the incident. It pointed out that jurisprudence laid down that the evidence on identity needs to be â€œclearâ€ and â€œunequivocalâ€. In this case the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was driving the vehicle at the time of the incident and that she was driving under the influence. It was also noted that while the police had alleged that bodycam used by officers on the scene was switched on at the time of the incident, footage was never presented in court. â€œHad this evidence been presented, it would clearly have helped the court to identify the person behind the wheel,â€ Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace said.

Tonamol Baby, an Indian national, was struck on July 16 and has remained in Mater Dei Hospitalâ€™s neurosurgical ward since. Her husband, Jacob Tom, visits her daily, gently speaking to her and holding her hand â€“ a quiet routine that began after the crash that changed everything for the couple. â€œItâ€™s our first baby. A boy,â€ says Tom, 34. â€œUnfortunately, July 20 was my birthday, and my boy passed on July 19.â€ He paused before adding, â€œI donâ€™t feel angry. I feel sad.â€ Tom, a man of small build, smiles as he steps away from his wife for a few minutes to walk out of the ward for the interview. He sits on a blue chair in the waiting room and places two mobile phones on the chair beside him: he carries her mobile around with him. He has been there since 8am. This is where he spends his days â€“ up until itâ€™s time for him to go to work at 6pm. â€œI am near her every day. In Malta, I am alone. I want to take her home to India. I think having family will help her get better faster,â€ he says. This is why he has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise the money he needs to take his wife back home, where she can be surrounded by family and continue her care. But this will cost about â‚¬50,000, which he cannot afford. An accident that changed everythingÂ  Tom came to Malta four years ago and initially worked as a bartender. After completing several courses, he became a sommelier and now works with the db Group. He got married to Tonamol, who he met in the area they are from, Kerala in the South of India. They married three years ago, and she moved to Malta a year later, initially working as a carer at Mater Dei Hospital. After she obtained her bridge course, she became a nurse and was based at St Vincent de Paul Residence. Tom usually joined her on her commute to work every day. â€œI will wake up when she gets ready for the duty and we take the bus from BuÄ¡ibba where we live. After I drop her off, I will come to sleep,â€ he says.  Holding on to hope Doctors told him there was no hope. They did not expect her to make it beyond 48 hours. But she did. And now days became weeks and months. â€œShe is still in a coma state, but she is totally different now. I can see almost the same face. She started to open her eyes. There is eye contact, but she is still not responding. There has been miniature progress from the first day but, for me, there were big changes,â€ he says, insisting that he is hopeful. He spends his day near her. For over a month, he did not report to work. But he has now decided to return â€“ for his mental health and to earn the money he needs. â€œRecently I started working â€“ my company, which I belong to, are very supportive. Every day I'm hereâ€¦ Iâ€™m away from here just for work. I work from 6pm to 1am. I get home at 3am. By 8am I am near her until it's time to go to work,â€ he says. But here in Malta he has no family support. This is why he would like to take his wife back to India where she will be provided with care for her condition and surrounded by family. But getting her home is too expensive. She would have to be transported in a medical ambulance for the cost of â‚¬20,000 and the hospital care is estimated to cost another â‚¬30,000. â€œI will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay, and I will bring her back with me.â€ Anyone who would like to help Tom take his wife home to India can access the crowdfunding pageÂ https://gogetfunding.com/prayers-and-support-needed-for-tonamol-babys-recovery/","{Accident,National}",Wednesday,,,,weekday,Attard,Triq l-Imdina,bypass,1,car,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lovin Malta,https://lovinmalta.com/lifestyle/health/husband-launches-fundraiser-to-bring-comatose-wife-home-after-crash/
419,Newsbook,Traffic collision case collapses over identification failure and police error,Jurgen Balzan,06/10/2025,23/09/2024,"A St Paulâ€™s Bay man accused of causing a traffic collision has been acquitted after the alleged victim failed to identify him in court and police failed to follow proper procedures during the investigation.
Dennis Attard, 49, of Triq l-Imsida, Santa Venera, faced five charges stemming from a collision on 23 September 2024 in Triq Censu Tabone, St Paulâ€™s Bay, including reckless driving, causing involuntary damage, driving without a licence, driving an unlicensed vehicle, and driving without insurance.
The case centred on a collision between Attardâ€™s vehicle and a motorcycle ridden by Marland Herman Jones.
Jones told the court he was riding down a narrow street when a car â€œjust kind of jumped inâ€ and pulled out in front of him. â€œI braked as hard as I could but I hit the I believe his door or the front right quarter panel,â€ he testified, adding that he â€œjust kind of fell over and jumped up cursing.â€
Jones explained that the driver claimed he had to leave urgently because â€œhis daughter was giving birth.â€ They exchanged phone numbers via WhatsApp, but when Jones attempted to contact him, he received no response despite seeing the messages had been viewed. â€œI tried to contact him again, no answer. He viewed the I saw it through the messaging app. I could tell that he watched it,â€ Jones testified.
However, when asked to identify the accused in court, Jones admitted: â€œActually at at this date I canâ€™t recognize him in court, if this is the gentleman, I donâ€™t quite recognize him, I have to be honest.â€ He explained he had identified someone at the police station â€œover 8 months agoâ€ but â€œcouldnâ€™t tell you now.â€
The defence suggested Jones had hit the car from behind, but Jones firmly rejected this, stating repeatedly: â€œThatâ€™d be completely incorrectâ€ and â€œThatâ€™d be incredibly incorrect.â€
Magistrate Yana Micallef Stafrace dismissed all charges on Monday, ruling that Jones â€œdid not recognise the accused in Courtâ€ and noting his claimed identification at the police station â€œdoes not result from the police affidavit.â€
Moreover, the court found that â€œon the day of the collision the right to silence was not administered to the accused as required by law.â€
Court therefore concluded that â€œthe evidence does not provide beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime, and therefore the imputations have not been proven to the degree required in the criminal field.â€
